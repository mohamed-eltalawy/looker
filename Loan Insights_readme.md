Activity overview
This lab is part of a capstone project. In this lab, you will apply your knowledge of the last two stages of the data journey, analyze and activate, by building an interactive dashboard that meets a business need using the Looker Enterprise user interface. You will be given a scenario and a set of tasks to complete. These tasks will require you to use your skills to build a dashboard with four visualizations, answer questions, and complete challenges that will test your data analysis and visualization skills.

By successfully completing this lab, you will have a user-friendly dashboard that you can add to your portfolio to showcase your skills to potential employers and gain additional experience using an enterprise-grade tool to meet challenges similar to those you encounter as a cloud data analyst.

Scenario
Trevor, the head of the Treasury department at The Look Fintech, is impressed with your work so far. Your ability to collect data from different sources and process it provides them with valuable insights for their business.

Now, Trevor has another task for you: develop a dashboard to help the team make the most of their loan health data and have quick and user-friendly access to the insights they need.

Trevor has identified four key business questions that the team regularly needs answers to when discussing loan health.

These questions are:

What is the total outstanding amount of all loans?
What is the percentage of outstanding loans in each status category?
What states have the highest number of outstanding loans?
What customers own their homes outright and have current loans?
Trevor also provided important information about the key metrics needed to answer these business questions.

The total balance of outstanding loans is the sum of all loan balances that have not been fully repaid. Lenders track this amount to understand their overall risk and financial health. In some jurisdictions, lenders are also required to collect this information to comply with regulations.

The loan status is an important attribute to track. The loan status identifies if the loan payments are current, late, charged off, in default, fully paid off or in a grace period. Trevor explained that to mitigate risk, it is important to track what percentage of outstanding loans fall into each category.

The borrower location is also a key consideration. The Treasury department is seeking to understand how loans are distributed geographically by state. This is because high concentrations of loans in one region can increase the risk of collective defaults. An even distribution of loans across regions can help to reduce this risk by ensuring that lenders are not overly reliant on any one area for their loan repayments.

The homeowner income index is a way to track the financial health of the borrowers using their income and home ownership status. This can help Trevor influence other teams to tailor their financial offering to the borrowers' needs as well as help make sure that they are meeting their goals of making borrowing accessible to a wide range of people.

The dashboard you create will have four visualizations that focus on these elements and help Trevor’s team get answers to their business questions.

First, you’ll get started with Looker and create a dashboard. Second, you’ll build a visualization that shows the total amount of all outstanding loans in a guided way. Third, you’ll build a visualization that displays the total amount of all outstanding loans by status. Then, you’ll challenge yourself to build a visualization to display the top 10 states with the highest total count of outstanding loans and a table that displays customers that own their home outright and have “Current” loans. Finally, you’ll customize your dashboard by enabling cross-filtering and setting the refresh rate for each Look.


Conclusion
As a cloud data analyst at TheLook Fintech, you’ve successfully built the dashboard Trevor and their team need to monitor the status of loans.

First, you created a visualization to display the total amount of outstanding loans.

Second, you created a visualization to display the total amount of outstanding loans by status.

Third, you created a visualization to display the top 10 states with the highest total count of outstanding loans.

Fourth, you created a visualization that displays customers who own their home outright and have “Current” loans.

Finally, you enabled cross-filtering on the loan status dashboard to make it easier for the users to interact with the data and understand how one measure relates to others and explored how to enable automatic refreshes to visualization on your own.

You are well on your way to understanding how to use Looker to build dashboards that help businesses monitor and track key performance indicators.
