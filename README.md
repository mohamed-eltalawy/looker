Activity overview
Enterprise-grade data visualization tools are used by organizations that need to manage and analyze large amounts of data. One popular enterprise-grade tool is Looker.

Looker is a business intelligence (BI) platform that helps you explore, analyze, visualize, and share your data. Looker Enterprise is a part of the Looker platform and is a powerful tool that can be used to visualize data, make better decisions, improve communication, and identify trends.

Looker Enterprise’s semantic layer and highly scalable architecture make it easy for analysts to explore large datasets without having to worry about the complexity of code. This ensures that all users are working from the same source information, eliminating the possibility of conflicting versions. Looker Enterprise's data governance model also empowers users to collaborate on insights while protecting sensitive data.

In this lab, you'll use an Explore in Looker Enterprise to build visualizations that support in-depth data analysis and critical business decision making.

Scenario
To gain insights into sales performance trends and facilitate comparisons with recent months, TheLook eCommerce's VP of Finance, Kiran, has requested an interactive dashboard summarizing sales data for 2022. This dashboard will enable Kiran to easily identify and highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue.

You decide to use Looker Enterprise to create a Business Insights dashboard, which is an interactive visualization that is used to better understand KPIs and the performance of a business over time.

Here’s how you'll do this: First, you’ll build a single value visualization and add it to a new dashboard. Next, you’ll add a line graph to display the trend of the total revenue for 2022, by product category, to the new dashboard. Then, you’ll add two more visualizations; a bar chart that displays average sale price by product, and a column chart that displays total revenue by country. Finally, you’ll add a country filter to the dashboard.
